Take your reading notes however you'd like, either __on paper, in a text file, or you are welcome to try a Jupyter Notebook.__  *In the future it will be important to do them in a notebook so you can practice new pieces of code.  This week you will get plenty of practice on Runestone Academy (see below).*  See the Complete Syllabus for some guidelines on reading notes.\n",

    "     \n",
    "    * You should take notes, but don't be overly detailed.  This is a book on scientific problem solving, but it focuses more on computer science vocabulary that I will.  I am more interested in having you do interactive practice of the concepts with the embedded questions.  \n",
