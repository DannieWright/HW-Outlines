# HW 2
## Due Thursday, Feb 1 @ 1pm
Normally you would have a pre-lab due at this time, but the focus of the Turtle lab is coding, not physics, so code practice is our focus.

### Goals: 
Practice the following code concepts using Python 
* Order of operations
* Built-in Functions, Packages, and Modules
* Comments 
* Control structures
   * If/else
   
### Reading: 
* GitHub Hello World document: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

   When you do this reading, work through the steps as outlined.  Instead of naming your repository "Hello World" name it "HW2_Reading_Notes"  Can you see where I'm going with this?  Take your reading notes for Newman in the README.md document you create.  If you want to learn a little bit about formatting a READMD.md file, notice it is a ".md" extension.  This stands for MarkDown, which is a language in
