The general form of the Simpson's method is  

$\int^b_a f(x) \ dx \approx \sum^N_{k=1} w_k \ f(x_k)$

where $x_k$ are the positions of the sample points at whih we calculate the integrand and the $w_k$ are weight values.

The coefficients are dependant on the polynomial conside the given below (remember that degree 1 is trapezoidal and degree 2 is the Simpson's):

Degree  Polynomial    Coefficients
1       Straight Line 1/2, 1, 1, ..., 1, 1/2
2       Quadratic     1/3, 4/3, 2/3, 4/3, ..., 4/3, 1/3
3       Cubic         3/8, 9/8, 9/8, 3/4, 9/8, 9/8, 3/4, ..., 9/8, 3/8
4       Quartic       14/45, 64/45, 8/15, 64/45, 28/45, 64/45, 8/15, 64/45, ..., 64/45, 14/45

Higher order integration rules like this are called the _Newton-Cotes formulas_.

# 5.7

**Trapezoidal Rule**:
 1) Good choice for quick integral since it is easy to program  
 2) Even spacing  
 3) Good for poorly behaved functions

**Simpson's Rule**
 1) Good for evenly spaced well behaved higher order integrands
 
**Romberg Integration**
 1) Best used for well behaved smooth functions 
 2) If do not need many data points/have few data points
 
**Gaussian Quadrature**
 1) Best for unevenly spaced points
 2) Well behaved high order functions
