These two subplots again show the fact the gaussian function decreases to a value near zero after around 2.5. This can be seen fairly
clearly by both plots leveling off to having a slope near zero after around 2.5. 

J(m,x)
"""
Description: returns the bessel function for the specified m-value at the specified x-value

Parameters: m - 
            x - independant variable at which the bessel function is being evaluated

Return: bessel function for the given m-value at the specified x-value
"""


intensity (radius, kValue)
"""
Description: returns the intensity based upon the radius away from the mid point and the given kValue

Parameters: radius - radial distance from centre
            kValue - 

Return: the intensity value based upon the radius and k-value
"""

This is a defraction pattern showing light intensity based upon colour hue. Physically this suggests light is a wave, 
since this is a property of waves.
